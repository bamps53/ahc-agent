# Development Guide

This document outlines the development practices, including setting up the environment, running checks, and the release process for `ahc-agent`.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git version control

## Setting up Development Environment

1.  **Install `uv`** (if you haven't already):
    `uv` は `pip` を使ってインストールできます。

    ```bash
    pip install uv
    ```

    または、公式のインストール手順に従ってください: [https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation)

2.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bamps53/ahc-agent
    cd ahc-agent
    ```

3.  **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies using `uv`**:
    `uv` は仮想環境の作成と依存関係のインストールを一度に行うことができます。

    ```bash
    uv sync --extra dev
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4.  **Install pre-commit hooks** (optional but highly recommended):
    This will run linters and formatters automatically before each commit.
    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    ```

## Running Linters and Tests

## Environment Variables

-   `AHCAGENT_LLM_LOGGING_DISABLED`: If set to `true`, disables logging of LLM API calls. This is useful for development and testing to prevent cluttering the workspace with log files. By default, logging is enabled.

Before committing or pushing changes, and especially before a release, ensure all checks pass.

- **Run Linters (Ruff)**:
  If you haven't installed pre-commit hooks, or want to run them manually:

  ```bash
  ruff check .
  ruff format .  # To apply formatting fixes
  ```

  To only check formatting without applying:

  ```bash
  ruff format --check .
  ```

- **Run Tests (Pytest)**:
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```
  This will discover and run all tests in the `tests/` directory.

## Release Process

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/).

### 1. Prerequisites for Releasing

- Ensure you have the latest versions of `build` and `twine`:
  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade build twine
  ```
- Ensure you have an account on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) and [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/).
- You must be a maintainer of the `ahc-agent` package on both platforms.
- Configure your `~/.pypirc` file with API tokens for `twine` for authentication (recommended over username/password):

  ```ini
  [testpypi]
    username = __token__
    password = <your_testpypi_api_token>

  [pypi]
    username = __token__
    password = <your_pypi_api_token>
  ```

  Replace `<your_testpypi_api_token>` and `<your_pypi_api_token>` with your actual API tokens generated from TestPyPI and PyPI respectively.

### 2. Pre-Release Steps

1.  **Update `main` Branch**:
    Ensure your local `main` branch is synchronized with the remote repository.

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    ```

2.  **Create a Release Branch** (optional, but good practice):
    Branch off `main` for the release. Replace `X.Y.Z` with the new version number.

    ```bash
    git checkout -b release/vX.Y.Z
    ```

3.  **Run All Checks**:

    - Ensure linters pass: `ruff check . && ruff format --check .` (or `pre-commit run --all-files`).
    - Ensure all tests pass: `pytest`.
    - Verify that the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) is passing for the latest commits on your release branch or `main`.

4.  **Update Version Number**:
    The version number needs to be updated in two places:

    - `pyproject.toml`: Update the `version = "X.Y.Z"` line under the `[project]` section.
    - `ahc_agent/__init__.py`: Update the `__version__ = "X.Y.Z"` string.
      Ensure both versions match exactly.

5.  **Update Changelog**:

    - Maintain a `CHANGELOG.md` file (create it if it doesn't exist).
    - Add a new section for the upcoming release (e.g., `## [vX.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`).
    - Document all significant changes: new features, bug fixes, breaking changes, deprecations, performance improvements, etc.

6.  **Commit Changes**:
    Commit the version update and changelog.

    ```bash
    git add pyproject.toml ahc_agent/__init__.py CHANGELOG.md
    git commit -m "chore: Prepare release vX.Y.Z"
    ```

7.  **Merge to `main`** (if using a release branch):

    - Create a Pull Request from your release branch (`release/vX.Y.Z`) to `main`.
    - Ensure all checks pass on the PR.
    - Get the PR reviewed and merge it into `main`.
    - After merging, switch back to `main` and pull the latest changes:
      ```bash
      git checkout main
      git pull origin main
      ```

8.  **Tag the Release**:
    Create an annotated Git tag on the `main` branch for the commit that represents the release.
    ```bash
    git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z" # Use the same version number
    ```

### 3. Build the Package

1.  **Clean Previous Builds** (recommended for a clean state):

    ```bash
    rm -rf dist/ build/ *.egg-info/
    ```

2.  **Build Source and Wheel Distributions**:
    Use the `build` package:
    ```bash
    python -m build
    ```
    This command will create a source distribution (`.tar.gz`) and a wheel (`.whl`) in the `dist/` directory.

### 4. Publish to TestPyPI (Highly Recommended)

Before publishing to the official PyPI, test the upload and installation process using TestPyPI.

1.  **Upload to TestPyPI**:

    ```bash
    twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
    ```

    If your `~/.pypirc` is not configured, you will be prompted for your TestPyPI username and API token.

2.  **Verify Installation from TestPyPI**:
    In a new, clean virtual environment, try installing your package from TestPyPI:
    ```bash
    # Create a new temporary directory and virtual environment
    python -m venv test_env
    source test_env/bin/activate
    pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple ahc-agent==X.Y.Z
    ```
    Replace `X.Y.Z` with the version you are releasing.
    Test basic functionality:
    ```bash
    ahc-agent --version
    # Optionally, run a simple command if feasible
    ```
    Deactivate and remove the test environment afterwards.

### 5. Publish to PyPI (Official Release)

Once you are confident that the package works correctly when installed from TestPyPI:

1.  **Upload to PyPI**:
    ```bash
    twine upload dist/*
    ```
    If your `~/.pypirc` is not configured, you will be prompted for your PyPI username and API token.

### 6. Post-Release Steps

1.  **Push Tags to GitHub**:
    Push the newly created Git tag to the remote repository.

    ```bash
    git push origin vX.Y.Z # Push the specific tag
    # Or push all tags (if you have multiple new tags)
    # git push origin --tags
    ```

    Ensure your `main` branch is also pushed if you didn't use a release branch that was merged.

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

2.  **Create a GitHub Release**:

    - Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
    - Go to the "Releases" section.
    - Click on "Draft a new release" or "Create a new release".
    - Select the tag you just pushed (e.g., `vX.Y.Z`).
    - Set the release title (usually the tag name, e.g., `vX.Y.Z`).
    - Copy the relevant release notes from `CHANGELOG.md` into the release description.
    - Optionally, you can upload the generated package files (`dist/*`) as binary attachments to the release.
    - Publish the release.

3.  **(Optional) Bump Version for Development**:
    After the release, you may want to update the version in your `main` branch to the next development version (e.g., `X.Y.(Z+1).dev0` or `X.(Y+1).0.dev0`).
    - Update version in `pyproject.toml` and `ahc_agent/__init__.py`.
    - Commit the change:
      ```bash
      git add pyproject.toml ahc_agent/__init__.py
      git commit -m "chore: Bump version to X.Y.Z.dev0 for development"
      git push origin main
      ```
