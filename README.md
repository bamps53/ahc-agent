# AHCAgent

A standalone command-line tool for solving AtCoder Heuristic Contest (AHC) problems using an AlphaEvolve-inspired approach.

## ‚ú® Features

- Problem analysis and solution strategy development utilizing LLMs.
- Solution search and optimization based on evolutionary algorithms.
- Docker integration for C++ code compilation and execution.
- Interactive mode supporting a step-by-step problem-solving process.
- Knowledge base feature for managing progress and results for each experiment session.
- Flexible configuration management via YAML files.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```bash
pip install ahc-agent
```

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Docker (required for C++ code compilation and execution)
- LLM API Access (supports OpenAI, Anthropic, etc., via LiteLLM)
- **Note:** You need to set environment variables like `OPENAI_API_KEY` to use LLM features.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1\. Initialize a Project

Initializes a new AHC project for a specific contest.
Creates a project directory (named after the `CONTEST_ID` by default, or as specified by `--workspace`)
and a configuration file (`config.yaml`) within it.
This configuration file will store the `contest_id`, as well as default `template` and `docker_image` settings.
The command will also attempt to scrape the problem statement for the given `CONTEST_ID`.

```bash
ahc-agent init ahc001 --workspace ./my_ahc_project
```

- `CONTEST_ID`: (Required) The ID of the AtCoder Heuristic Contest (e.g., `ahc001`).
- `--workspace PATH` (`-w`): Specify the directory to create the project in.
  If not set, a directory named after the `CONTEST_ID` is created in the current location.

### 2\. Solve a Problem

Solves the problem based on the problem description and configuration within the specified workspace directory.
**The workspace directory must contain `problem.md` (the problem statement) and `config.yaml` (the project configuration).**
If test case files (e.g., `test01.txt`, `test02.txt`) exist in the `tools/in` subdirectory of the workspace, they will be automatically used for evaluation. Otherwise, test cases will be generated by the LLM based on the problem analysis.

```bash
ahc-agent solve path/to/your_workspace_directory --interactive
```

- `WORKSPACE`: Path to the workspace directory.
- `--interactive` (`-i`): Enable interactive mode for solving.
- `--session-id` (`-s`): Session ID for resuming a previous solve session.

### 3\. Solve a Problem in Interactive Mode

Guides you through the problem-solving process step-by-step using the problem and configuration in the specified workspace.
**The workspace directory must contain `problem.md` and `config.yaml`.**

```bash
ahc-agent solve path/to/your_workspace_directory --interactive
```

Available commands in interactive mode:

- `analyze`: Execute problem analysis.
- `strategy`: Devise solution strategy.
- `testcases`: Generate test cases and score calculator.
- `initial`: Generate initial solution.
- `evolve`: Run evolutionary search.
- `status`: Display current status.
- `help`: Display command list.
- `exit`: Exit interactive mode.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Configuration is primarily managed by the `config.yaml` file within the workspace. Settings specified in this file will override the global default settings.

- **Workspace Configuration (`config.yaml`)**: These are project (workspace) specific settings. When the `init` command is executed, basic settings such as the contest ID are written to this file. Users can customize settings like the LLM model and Docker image by editing this file.
- **Default Configuration**: If a specific key is not present in `config.yaml`, or if the file itself does not exist (e.g., when manually preparing a workspace without running `init` before executing the `solve` command), the application's built-in default settings will be used.

Currently, the functionality to override detailed configuration values via command-line options or environment variables is limited.
